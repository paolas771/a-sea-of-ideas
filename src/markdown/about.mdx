# About Me
Hi, I'm Paola. When I was a child, I was not very creative so as an adult I try to be as creative as I can to get out of my comfort zone. 
## Bookbinding
I started my first hobby at the ripe age of 23 and have not looked back. Thanks to TikTok, I was introduced to bookbinding. I have always loved reading and thought it was very cool that people would make their own covers for books so I gave it a try and I loved it. 

My first few try's were not the greatest but that did not stop me. I started with books I had laying around. I would experiment with the designs, decide what color cover I wanted. I had complete creative control on how I wanted this book to look and it got even better. I learned that you could bind fanfics as well and while the process does take longer since there is no physical copy of the book and you have to typeset it from scratch, and print it out, and bind it, and this and that, I still enjoyed it very much. 

## Sewing
Now, while I still bookbind everyone now and then. I don't do it as much as I used to since I have picked up sewing. Sewing has been something I have always wanted to do but was always intimated by it. I always questioned how the stitching wouldn't just fall out of something I created. 

Again thanks to TikTok, I learned that all you have to do is backstitch and now it didn't seem so intimating. So, in 2024 I made my first ever book sleeve and boy was it ugly. I couldn't even put a book in it. I had made it to small, it was very uneven, it had holes along the seams, and the seams were not ironed. *(which I now do after every stitch)* That did not stop me though I pushed through I made another and another and another till I finally got it right threw in on a self and never looked at that book sleeve again. 

I moved on to making boxy pouches like every other beginner sewist. Now everywhere I went, I would see something I liked and say I could make that like I was a pro. I made buckets hats, tote bags, purses, key fobs, etc.. I started gaining more confidence and started sewing things with circles, used bias binding, learned differenct types of seams; the knowledge was endless. This year I want to move away from making bags and start making my own cloths. I did one dress last year that came out super cute. I got so many compliments from my family and the feeling of saying 'Thanks I made it' is one I love.
## Embroidery 
While learning to sew, I also started hand embroidery and while it's not my favorite just cause it takes me a long time to finish one work. I like that it makes me slow down and just sit with myself. I love adding my finish pieces on things that I have sew. One day I would like to get an embroidery machine but right now my bank is telling me hell no!

## Drawing
I started drawing so I could make my own book covers and design fabric of my own. I got kinda of side tracked though and mostly just draw One Piece characters. Now while I do feel like I have gotten better I am not the best and it will probably be a while before I share any of my drawings on here. Anatomy is my worse enemy but I will defeat it one day.

In the end, I can say that my love for reading is what started all this hobby collecting because without it I would never have started bookbinding and without bookbinding I would not have the confidence I needed to be where I am today.
