# Hi, I'm Paola
Come along as I bring my ideas to life. I love trying out new things and challenging myself to become better at my current hobbies, which at the moment include sewing, embroidery, drawing, and bookbinding.

This blog is dedicated to documenting the process of my ideas coming to life whether its sewing, embroidery, or drawing. So come along on my journey to become more creative.
