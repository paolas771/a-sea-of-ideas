## Getting Started
**Use a 3/8 in. seam allowance unless told otherwise **

To get started, you want to iron on your interfacing to each respective main fabric piece. If you don't have iron on interfacing you can simple sew very close to the edge of the fabric to stitch the interfacing in place. 

>Optional: You could use quilting batting and quilt your fabric. Just be aware the bag won't have as much structure as it would have with regular interfacing. 

Now we want to create our straps. At this point the main fabric should have the interfacing ironed on. You're gonna grab the 18 in. x 2 in. main and lining pieces and put them right sides together. Clip down the sides and sew along the edge on both sides with a **1/4 in seam allowance**. Repeat this process for the other strap. When done you're gonna flip them inside out so the right side of the fabric is on the outside. 

> **Tip**: I don't have one of those fancy tools to turn fabric inside out, so I use a safety pin and pin it to the top edge of one side of the fabric and pull the safety pin though by bunching up the fabric and pulling the frabic though as I make my way to the other end.

Now that fabric is flipped to the correct side you are going to iron it since it will be very wrinkle at this point. Also, it's just good practice to iron along every seam you sew; it will make a huge difference in your creations. Next, you will top stitch across each edge. I keep the allowance to under 1/4 in. to make sure that the seam we created stays in place.
