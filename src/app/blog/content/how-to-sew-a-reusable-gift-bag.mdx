# How to: Sew a Reusable Gift Bag
In this tutorial, you will learn how to sew a reusable gift bag. I use these all the time for gifts but they could also be used as tote bags or however you see fit. This tutorial will make a 11H x 9.5L x 6.25W bag but feel free to change the sizes to get a smaller or bigger bag. 

Supplies needed:

 - **Main Fabric**
	 - 11.75 in. x 10.25 in.  - 2 pieces
	 - 11.75 in. x 7 in. - 2 pieces
	 - 10.25 in. x 7 in. - 1 piece
	 - 18 in. x 2 in. - 2 pieces
 - **Lining Fabric**
	 - 11.75 in. x 10.25 in.  - 2 pieces
	 - 11.75 in. x 7 in. - 2 pieces
	 - 10.25 in. x 7 in. - 1 piece
	 - 18 in. x 2 in. - 2 pieces
 - **Iron on Interfacing** - I use Pellon 808 Craft fuse
	- 11.75 in. x 10.25 in.  - 2 pieces
	 - 11.75 in. x 7 in. - 2 pieces
	 - 10.25 in. x 7 in. - 1 piece
	 - 18 in. x 2 in. - 2 pieces

## Getting Started
**Use a 3/8 in. seam allowance unless told otherwise**

To get started, you want to iron on your interfacing to each respective main fabric piece. If you don't have iron on interfacing you can simple sew very close to the edge of the fabric to stitch the interfacing in place. 

>Optional: You could use quilting batting and quilt your fabric. Just be aware the bag won't have as much structure as it would have with regular interfacing.

Now we want to create our straps. At this point the main fabric should have the interfacing ironed on. You're gonna grab the 18 in. x 2 in. main and lining pieces and put them right sides together. Clip down the sides and sew along the edge on both sides with a **1/4 in seam allowance**. Repeat this process for the other strap. When done you're gonna flip them inside out so the right side of the fabric is on the outside. 

> **Tip**: I don't have one of those fancy tools to turn fabric inside out, so I use a safety pin and pin it to the top edge of one side of the fabric and pull the safety pin though by bunching up the fabric and pulling the frabic though as I make my way to the other end.

Now that fabric is flipped to the correct side you are going to iron it since it will be very wrinkle at this point. Also, it's just good practice to iron along every seam you sew; it will make a huge difference in your creations. Next, you will top stitch across each edge. I keep the allowance to **under 1/4 in.** to make sure that the seam we created stays in place.

## Let the Sewing Begin
*I like to iron my seams between each step for a cleaner look*

### Step 1
I being with the front and back pieces and the bottom piece. You want to clip the long side of the bottom with the short side of the front and back pieces with right sides touching. If you have fabric with patterns facing a certain direction make sure the pattern is facing the correct way. Take this to your sewing machine and sew along the edge.

### Step 2
Next, we are going attach the side pieces. Clip the short sides together with right sides touching and sew along the edge.

### Step 3
By now, your bottom pieces should be sewed to the sides, front, and back pieces. Next, you want to grab one side and the front panel and stand them up to line the top up and clip down the side with right sides touching. Do this on all four sides pieces and when you are done your bag you should be able to see the structure of the bag. Take this to your sewing machine and sew along each side.

### Step 4 

You're going to repeat steps 1-3 for the lining of the bag the only difference is when you are sewing the four sides together make sure that on one side you leave a gap wide enough to flip the fabric inside out when sewing.

### Step 5 
Now, we want to attach the straps to the main body of the bag. Measure 1.5 inches from each side and clip one side of the side in place repeat for the other side. Take it to the sewing machine a baste it in place.

### Step 6
Next, we are going put it all together. So you want to put the main body of the bad inside the lining with right sides touching and making sure the straps are sandwich between the main bag and the lining. Line up the four seams at the top and clip around the opening. Take it the sewing machine and sew along the edge.

### Step 7
Once you are done, you're gonna use the gap in the lining and turn the bag inside out. With the bag inside out you want to now close the gap by ironing it to make sure it's aligned and taking it to the sewing machine and sewing as close to the edge as you can.

> **Optional:** You can use a ladder stitch and hand sew the gap close.

Once the gap is closed, you want to push the lining into the main body of the bag and iron down the top seam that we just did. This will allow for a crisp look and will make it easier to stitch around the top. Take it to the sewing machine and top stitch around the top with a **1/4 in. seam allowance**.

### Last Step 

Lastly, to give it more structure we are going to sew each corner together. I lay down the bag and iron down the corner then clip down the side with one hand inside the bag to make sure the lining is also being clipped. Take it to the sewing machine and sew from top to bottom along the edge with a **3/8 in. seam allowance**. Repeat this step for all four corners.
